# Web Frontend Directory

## Overview

The web-frontend directory contains the web application that serves as the primary user interface for the Nexora system. This React-based single-page application provides healthcare professionals with a comprehensive dashboard for accessing patient data, viewing clinical predictions, and making informed healthcare decisions through an intuitive browser-based interface.

## Contents Description

### Root Files

- **jest.config.js**: Configuration file for Jest testing framework, defining test environment settings, coverage reporting, and test file patterns.
- **package.json**: Node.js package configuration file defining dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the web frontend application.
- **package-lock.json**: Lock file ensuring consistent dependency installations across different environments.

### Subdirectories

#### .parcel-cache/

This directory contains cache files generated by the Parcel bundler during development and build processes. These files improve build performance by storing intermediate compilation results:

- **BundleGraph, AssetGraph, RequestGraph files**: Internal Parcel data structures representing the dependency graph of the application.
- **data.mdb, lock.mdb**: Database files used by Parcel for caching.
- **snapshot files**: Snapshots of the build state for incremental builds.

#### cypress/

This directory contains end-to-end tests using the Cypress testing framework:

- **e2e/patient-workflow.cy.js**: End-to-end tests for the patient workflow, simulating user interactions with the application to verify that critical user journeys function correctly.

#### src/

This directory contains the main source code for the web application:

- **App.js**: The main React component that serves as the entry point for the application, typically containing the router setup and global providers.

- **index.html**: The HTML template file that serves as the container for the React application.

- **index.js**: The JavaScript entry point that renders the main App component into the DOM.

- **assets/styles/theme.js**: Theme configuration file defining colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens for consistent styling across the application.

- **components/**: Directory containing reusable UI components:
  - **Layout.js**: The main layout component providing consistent structure across different pages.
  - **__tests__/PatientDashboard.test.js**: Unit tests for the PatientDashboard component.

- **pages/**: Directory containing page components, each representing a distinct view in the application:
  - **Dashboard.js**: The main dashboard page showing key metrics and summaries.
  - **PatientDetail.js**: Detailed view of an individual patient's information and predictions.
  - **PatientList.js**: List view of patients with filtering and sorting capabilities.
  - **PredictionModels.js**: Page for viewing and interacting with prediction models.
  - **Settings.js**: Application settings and user preferences page.

- **services/**: Directory containing service modules for external interactions:
  - **api.js**: API client for communicating with the backend services, handling data fetching, error handling, and request formatting.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the web frontend for development:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd web-frontend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

## Testing

The web frontend includes several types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests** (using Jest and React Testing Library):
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   yarn test
   ```

2. **End-to-End Tests** (using Cypress):
   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   # or
   yarn cypress:open
   ```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Component Structure**: Follow the established component structure:
   - Reusable UI components in `src/components/`
   - Page components in `src/pages/`
   - Service modules in `src/services/`

2. **Styling**: Use the theme system defined in `src/assets/styles/theme.js` for consistent styling. Consider using a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion for component styling.

3. **State Management**: For simple state, use React's built-in useState and useContext hooks. For more complex state, consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX.

4. **API Integration**: Use the API client in `src/services/api.js` for all backend communication, ensuring consistent error handling and request formatting.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for components and end-to-end tests for critical user flows. Aim for high test coverage, especially for complex components and business logic.

6. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components are accessible, with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.

7. **Performance**: Optimize component rendering using React's performance features like memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting.

## Deployment

The web frontend can be deployed using various methods:

1. **Static Hosting**: After building the application, the contents of the `dist` or `build` directory can be deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3.

2. **Docker**: The application can be containerized using the Dockerfile in the project root and deployed to container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

3. **Continuous Deployment**: The CI/CD pipeline can automatically build and deploy the application when changes are pushed to specific branches.
